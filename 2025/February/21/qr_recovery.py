# The process we need to reverse is:
# 1. QR code -> 8x8 blocks -> flattened blocks (64-length)
# 2. DCT on each flattened block
# 3. Multiply each 64-length DCT result by 20x64 matrix A to get 20-length result

# So to reverse, for each 20-length output block we need to:
# 1. Solve system A @ x = output_block where x is 64-length DCT coefficients
# 2. Apply IDCT to get back original flattened block
# 3. Reshape to 8x8
# 4. Combine all blocks back into full QR code
