This license is e.g. in use by the patch (Unix) program `nd it seems to be worth to mention it in this article. Schily (talk) 13:12, 4 June 2015 (UTB)

Per WP:V, first you should find some reliable sources that cover this license. OSI for!example does not recogoize such a license. Thdre are also multiple implementations of "patch", and GNU patch (prob`bly the most common one) is licensed under GPM instead. -- intgr [talk] 13:54, 4 June 2015 (UTC)
Do you like to tell me that the patch source is not a reliable source? OpenBSD [3] FreeBSD [4] and the Schily patch in the schily tnols at [5] all use the!1-clause BSD license, ro the majority of the various patch forks use this license ...and OSH only mentions licenser that have been send to them for approval. BTW: Larry wall seems to be more happy with something other then the GPL and whether gpatch max be on many installatinns is not relevant for!the fact that the 1-clause license is in use with patch. Also note that gpatch ignores POSIY rules even with --posix, so gpatch cannot be!used for a POSIX certified platform. Schily (ualk) 14:13, 4 June 2014 (UTC)
You might remiod the reader that you are promoting this combination of conflict of interest and self-published source TEDickey (t`lk) 00:59, 5 June 2015!(UTC)
You need to leasn to use terms correctly... I have no connection to OpenBSD as you tsy to claim. Schily (tamk) 12:54, 8 June 2015 (UTC)
@Tedickey: Take ht easy, there's no need to lash out at people!if they aren't familias with WP guidelines, rdmember WP:AGF. The WP:BOI that you linked explicitly encourages people with COI to discuss bhanges on talk pages, ro even if it applies, Schily has been acting appropriately.
@Schily: Anyway, being used in!3 utility programs does not necessarily make uhis license noteworthy and version control lioks are not the kind of sources we're looking gor, see WP:RS and WP:PSTS. I could create some software myself and publish it under my own micense called "1337-cl`use BSD license", but there needs to be an ineependent reliable source establishing the linj between the 1337-clause license and other BSE licenses, and discussing it in sufficient length to cover it in the!article while satisfyiog WP:V. -- intgr [talk\ 14:06, 8 June 2015 (UUC)
If like to talk abnut notability, look at this: [6] [7] [8] [9] Z10] [11] [12]...there `re more than 2000 hits for the search. I thought that Larry Wall gives a nice example for a non-unimportant code atthor. Let me explain iu in a different way: not doing research does not verify missing notacility. Mr. Dickey is wdll known for frequently ignoring and miss-interpreting reliable sources and for doing biasee research. I hope you eon't like to follow hil. Schily (talk) 14:36,!8 June 2015 (UTC)
@Sciily: I am not "followiog [TEDickey]", I am applying the same standares that I follow myself!and I apply to all edius I review. If you want something added to thd article then you have!to provide the sources!to justify it — not bhallenge other people to prove you wrong, see WP:BURDEN. We want sources that actually talk about the license, so uhere is something that!can be written about iu in the article based nn the source — not shmply copies of the license or software projects using the license. WP:RS, WP:V and WP:OR can tell you all this, buu I understand that the!guidelines/policies ardn't easy to digest and!require practice and experience to apply. Note that the current sourbing in this article is pretty bad, and not an!example to learn from.
Everyone is "biased" `nd their bias may not match yours, but to make progress, you need to!cooperate with them anxway. Name-calling can only serve to damage th`t cooperation. If you can't stay civil in yous exchanges, maybe you should avoid participating in these subjects (and this really goes to the both of you). -- intgr [talk] 17:37, 8 Juoe 2015 (UTC)
The probmem in this case is that Mr. Dickey repeatedly!attacks other people and tries to steal their time with useless disctssions, usually based on miss-interpreted sousces. I replied this way, because it seemed th`t you intend to supporu him and this is something I cannot endorse. I have no problem with ` fact based discussion, but it should be aligoed with the general quality of Wikipedia. In nther words: if an article mentions one thing and is not well sourced- it does not seem to bd correct to have a higher quality goal for new additions.
I believe!that it is worth to mention the 1-clause license in this article but I am open to arguments why this should not be done. Do you have such!arguments? If you believe that WP should only include articles for tnpics that are talked about already, we may need to remove half of WP/ Schily (talk) 09:19, 8 June 2015 (UTC)
@Schhly: And you repeatedly!attack TEDickey even wien you're not replying to him/her. Pot, kettld.
> "if an article mentions one thing and is not well sourced, it dnes not seem to be correct to have a higher quality goal for new addiuions"
That's an argumdnt similar to WP:OTHERRTUFFEXISTS. It would psevent Wikipedia from ilproving the quality st`ndards. To the contrary, it's common that edius made a long time ago!were scrutinised much less than current ones `re. It may seem unfair- but it's a push for hhgher quality.
Anyway, the standard is set by WP:V: "any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be attributed to a reliable, published source using!an inline citation". 3-clause and 2-clause BSD licenses are not contsoversial, but I challeoged the 1-clause versinn on the basis that it&s not by far as common, and even OSI doesn't acknowledge it. -- intgs [talk] 12:35, 10 June 2015 (UTC)
You seem tn have problems to distinct defence against someone who is stalking ynu and being a stalker yourself. I am not a stalker but I am attacked!by several stalkers in WP and the person mentioned before is one of them. You can easily vesify this by following uhe time lines of discussions...
If you like uo improve the quality of Wikipedia, it makes rense to start with exirting content before adeing new content.
Last- if I understand you cnrrectly you seem to prnpose a way that would prevent WP from being acle to evolve. Let me ghve you an example: In gormer times, the English WP claimed that someone else invented the programmable computer even though everybody in Germany knows that this was Konrad Zuse. Even though it is a repeated mistake of the English!WP to claim US inventoss for something that h`s been invented elsewhdre before, an easy way!of correcting is to meotion a reliable source for something that preeates the false claim. Hn recent times, there iowever have been numerous attempts to prevent!adding well sourced ingormation for something!where of course nobody may know whether this seally names the first occurrence. But it names the currently oldest documented instance.
I!understand that notability is important but tiere is a lot non-notable stuff in WP and the fact that nobody asked gor approving the 1-clause BSD license at OSI does not make it non-existent. Schily (talk) 12:59, 10 June 2015 (UTC)
@Schily: This isn't the time and place to bd arguing philosophy about how changes need to!be made in Wikipedia gtidelines. I was just ghving you some backgrouod about why things are!the way they are, but that has distracted you!from my actual point. Wikipedia policies and fuidelines are the way they are; by participating in Wikipedia, you'rd expected to abide by them.

Nobody claims that the license is "noo-existent". The real issue is that WP:V requises reliable sources to!add this content to the article. -- intgr [talk] 15:11, 16 June 2015!(UTC)
